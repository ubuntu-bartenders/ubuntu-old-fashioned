# Ubuntu Old Fashioned
![Ubuntu Old Fashioned](ubuntu-old-fashioned.png)

Sometimes you don't want the modern comfort of a distributed build system.

Sometimes just just want to look at a directory and be like "build this now".

Sometimes you don't want to use this scary newfangled "cloud" thing.

Sometimes you're in the mood for something nice and sequential.

Well look no more!

This script is meant to let you build ubuntu cloud images locally from a
livecd-rootfs checkout.

Want this to be even simpler? Don't want to check anything out yourself?

Use the [Ubuntu Bartender](scripts/ubuntu-bartender/ubuntu-bartender) to
manage the Ubuntu Old Fashioned build for you.

## Installation

On Ubuntu (**works for Focal, Bionic or Xenial**):

The easiest way to install is to use the included setup script:

`./setup-old-fashioned`

Note: Since old-fashioned relies on launchpad buildd to be available, it will
unfortunately not work until that package is made available for other series.

## Example

The most simple example to build all ubuntu-cpc images from scratch is:

```bash
git clone lp:livecd-rootfs
cd livecd-rootfs
sudo old-fashioned-image-build
```

The images will be copied to your $HOME in a "build.output/" folder after about
30 minutes.

## Speeding things up a bit

To speed up package lookup you can install "squid-deb-proxy" on the host, then
point the host to its own proxy by adding a file like the following:

```bash
export LXD_ADDRESS=$(ifconfig lxdbr0 | grep 'inet addr:' | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{ print $1}')
cat > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/30squid-proxy << EOF
Acquire::http::Proxy "http://$LXD_ADDRESS:8000";
EOF
```

The script will autodetect proxy settings as long as they are set in a file in
/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/ .

## Extra hooks

If you would like to build with extra hooks, you need to nest them under the
ubuntu-cpc part of the livecd-rootfs tree:

```bash
git clone lp:livecd-rootfs
git clone lp:my-extra-hooks
cp -a my-extra-hooks/extra livecd-rootfs/live-build/ubuntu-cpc/hooks
```

Please make sure your hook files are **executable**.
